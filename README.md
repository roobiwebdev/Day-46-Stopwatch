#Day46 of #100DaysChallenge

Hey everyone! 

Today I built a sleek and functional Stopwatch‚è±Ô∏è using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

Key Features:

Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.

Millisecond Accuracy: Tracks time down to the hundredth of a second.

Responsive Design: Looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Clean & Modern Aesthetics: Visually appealing design with subtle animations on button hover.
Excited to keep building and learning!
